	GitHub, Inc. is a United States-based global company that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features.
	GitHub offers its basic services free of charge. Its more advanced professional and enterprise services are commercial.[5] Free GitHub accounts are commonly used to host open-source projects.[6] As of January 2019, GitHub offers unlimited private repositories to all plans, including free accounts, but allowed only up to three collaborators per repository for free.[7] Starting from April 15, 2020, the free plan allows unlimited collaborators, but restricts private repositories to 2,000 actions minutes per month.[8] As of January 2020, GitHub reports having over 40 million users[9] and more than 100 million repositories[10] (including at least 28 million public repositories),[11] making it the largest host of source code in the world.[12]
	In 2010, GitHub announced that it was hosting 1 million repositories.[15] A year later, this number doubled.[16] ReadWriteWeb reported that GitHub had surpassed SourceForge and Google Code in total number of commits for the period of January to May 2011.[17] On January 16, 2013, GitHub announced it had passed the 3 million users mark and was then hosting more than 5 million repositories.[18] By the end of the year, the number of repositories were twice as much, reaching 10 million repositories.[19]

	PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language. It is developed by the Czech company JetBrains.[6] It provides code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester, integration with version control systems (VCSes), and supports web development with Django as well as Data Science with Anaconda.[7] 

PyCharm is cross-platform, with Windows, macOS and Linux versions. The Community Edition is released under the Apache License,[8] and there is also Professional Edition with extra features â€“ released under a proprietary license. 

In 2020, Python has become a well-liked programming language for application development. The reason for its popularity lies in its simplicity in designing codes. For writing simple and efficient Python codes, we need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We use PyCharm as an IDE for developing Python-based applications.

	Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.[7] Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.

	Visual Studio Code's source code comes from Microsoft's free and open-source software VSCode project released under the permissive Expat License,[8] but the compiled binaries are freeware for any use.[9]

	In the Stack Overflow 2019 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular developer environment tool, with 50.7% of 87,317 respondents claiming to use it.[10]

	Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Go, Node.js and C++.[14][15][16][17] It is based on the Electron framework,[18] which is used to develop Node.js web apps that run on the Blink layout engine. Visual Studio Code employs the same editor component (codenamed "Monaco") used in Azure DevOps (formerly called Visual Studio Online and Visual Studio Team Services).[19]
