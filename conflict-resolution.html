<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>Maximum prcedence is given to the last declared style.So the top priority is given to the 'INLINE' declaration and then the external/Internal CSS.</p>
<p>The only condition is that the target should be same and styling should also be same.</p>
<h3>Merge</h3>
<p>The condition fo this is that the target of the cascade style sheet should same but the styling is different.Then both the stylings are merged and both are applied to the target element.</p>
<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<p>So when any styling is applied to a element/tag the same styling is inherited by the child of that element/tag and it is applied to all levels of its childrens.But the other way is not true.</p>
<h3>Specificity</h3>
<p>The selector declaration having more Specificity will be applied to the target element.</p>
<p>There are four parameters that we use to define the Specificity of a selector combination:</p>
<p>Inline Styling > ID > Class > Elements</p>
