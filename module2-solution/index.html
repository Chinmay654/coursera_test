We love the cuisine because it’s loaded with flavor and spice and is great for cold nights. One dish we keep going back for is the butter chicken.The spicy creaminess is unforgettable and always makes us go back for more!I’ve been experimenting with my own version of home-made butter chicken over the past few weeks and I’ve finally found the perfect one. This simple no-fuss one pan butter chicken is just perfect. It’s simplified and does not require a whole bunch of ingredients, yet it’s packed with just the right amount of spice.</section></div>
	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><p id="p2">Beef</p><section>With its tender chunks of beef coated in a luscious creamy sauce and served over a bed of buttery noodles, it’s no wonder Beef Stroganoff is such a hit. With all that flavor, you might assume it’s a complicated dish, but it’s actually quite the opposite. This from-scratch recipe can be made in well under an hour and with only 20 minutes of hands-on time, since it’s really all about the simmer. (The key to transforming the beef into succulent morsels of mouthwatering meat.) So when you want to impress the family but don’t have all day to do it—this one’s a guaranteed hit!</section></div>
	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12"><p id="p3">Sushi</p><section>Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian.Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.</section></div>
